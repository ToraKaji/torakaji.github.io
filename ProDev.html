Write a paragraph on how you balance your creativity and logic in you _passion projects_:

	1. I often find myself playing at home with my Arduino Atmega2650. I will set up lights to flash in conjunction with a song, or 	will use a sonar sensor to determine distance. I feel this is using both halves of my brain becuase I have a goal in mind that I
	need to use my technical know-how to do, but there are also certain ways to go about it, and I am often creative with my
	solutions. 

Why,what,how + question.

	1. Why: I'm looking to improve the world and the people's lives around me.
	
	2. What: I'm going to learn Java and Android and contribute to the great number of useful applications and projects
	that the community and I have started. 
	
	3. How: Through coding and the ease of computers.
	
	4. Hi, I'm JR. I'm currently learning Java and Android at CNM. I'm looking to create a world of technology that can
	simplify life and help people be more productive. I'm going to do this through the use of computers. Do you have a business
	card?
