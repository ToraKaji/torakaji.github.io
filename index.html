		<h3>	Week three</h3>
		<p>Glad we are starting Adroid! It's super confusing.. but I'm slowly getting the hang of it. It makes sense when you start to think about it but then you get another assigment and your back to thinking about one thing for 3 days. Hit the ground running and hope to get it down.
		<h3>	Week two</h3>
		<p>Learning a lot more each passing day. I really liked the regular expression tutorials that we did. I feel it will be pretty useful in the weeks to come.</p>
		<h3> 	Week one</h3>
		<p>Had fun this week learning a lot. Going to practice more Java and Android. As well as reasearch more practical applications of programming.</p>

		<h4>Write a short paragraph about how you will bridge the two over the next couple of years.</h4>
		<p>I intend on making the connection between these two images by completing the Java + Android Bootcamp and hopefully scoring job at a good tech company where I can pursue my interests and become a productive and helpful perfson to society.

	<h2>Write a paragraph on how you balance your creativity and logic in your passion projects:</h2>
	<p> I often find myself playing at home with my Arduino Atmega2650. I will set up lights to flash in conjunction with a song, or will use a sonar sensor<br>
		to determine distance. I feel this is using both halves of my brain because I have a goal in mind that I need to use my technical know-how<br> to do, but there are also certain ways to go about it, and I am often creative with my
		solutions. </p>

	<h2>What, Why, and How: </h2>

	<p>1. Why: I'm looking to improve the world and the people's lives around me.<br>
	
	<p>2. What: I'm going to learn Java and Android and contribute to the great number of useful applications and projects that the community and I have started. <br>
	
	<p>3. How: Through coding and the ease of computers.<br>
	
		<h2>Elevator Pitch:</h2>
	<p>4. Hi, I'm JR. I'm currently learning Java and Android at CNM. I'm looking to create a world of technology that can
	<p>simplify life and help people be more productive. I'm going to do this through the use of computers. Do you have a business
	<p>card?
