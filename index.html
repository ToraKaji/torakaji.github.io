<p>Write a paragraph on how you balance your creativity and logic in you _passion projects_:

	<p>1. I often find myself playing at home with my Arduino Atmega2650. I will set up lights to flash in conjunction with a song, or will use a sonar sensor to determine distance. I feel this is using both halves of my brain becuase I have a goal in mind that I
	<p>need to use my technical know-how to do, but there are also certain ways to go about it, and I am often creative with my
	<p>solutions. 

	<h2>What, Why, and How: </h2>

	<ul>1. Why: I'm looking to improve the world and the people's lives around me.<br>
	
	<ul>2. What: I'm going to learn Java and Android and contribute to the great number of useful applications and projects that the community and I have started. <br>
	
	<ul>3. How: Through coding and the ease of computers.<br>
	
		<h2>Elevator Pitch:</h2>
	<p>4. Hi, I'm JR. I'm currently learning Java and Android at CNM. I'm looking to create a world of technology that can
	<p>simplify life and help people be more productive. I'm going to do this through the use of computers. Do you have a business
	<p>card?
